The Snowdrop team is pleased to inform you that we're planning to release a new Snowdrop BOM on *{{releaseDate}}*
based on Spring Boot *{{version}}*.

Some of our artifacts depend on your product and we need to know which product version we should be using for this new
release which we intend to support until *{{endOfSupportDate}}*.

We expect to start testing our new release based on Spring Boot *{{version}}* on *{{dueDate}}*.
We therefore request a support statement from your team in the form of the following information:
- Product name and version (e.g. JWS - 5.3.1)
- Supported (productized) version (e.g. 9.0.30-redhat-00001)
- Date of end of support
- (optional) PNC/Indy URL (e.g. [http://indy.psi.redhat.com/browse/maven/]...)
- (optional) MRRC URL, if already released (e.g. [https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/]...)

Please let us know if the product support will lapse before *{{endOfSupportDate}}*.

Thank you in advance for your help!

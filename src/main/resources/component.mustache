The Snowdrop team is pleased to inform you that we're planning to release a new Snowdrop BOM on *{{releaseDate}}*
based on Spring Boot *{{version}}*.

Some of our artifacts depend on your product and we need to know which product version we should be using for this new
release.

While we don't require a new release of your product as long as the artifacts you provide us with are tested and supported
on Spring Boot *{{version}}*, it's important that you let us know until when your product is supported so that we can plan
future releases accordingly. For reference, we will support this new release until *{{endOfSupportDate}}*.

Thank you in advance for your help!

- Please provide this information before *{{dueDate}}*, date at which we expect to start testing our new release.

The Snowdrop team is pleased to inform you that we're planning to release a new Snowdrop BOM on *{{releaseDate}}*
based on Spring Boot *{{version}}*.

Some of our artifacts depend on your product and we need to know which product version we should be using for this new
release.

+*Notes:*+
* We will support this new release until *{{endOfSupportDate}}* so it's important that you let us know until when your
product is supported so that we can plan future releases accordingly.
* We don't require a new release of your product as long as the artifacts you provide us with are tested and supported
on Spring Boot *{{version}}*.
* *{color:red}Please only resolve this issue when all the information is provided below and the associated artifacts are available.{color}*

Thank you in advance for your help!

Please add the required information, *{color:red}without changing the format as it's automatically processed on our side{color}*,
in the section below before *{{dueDate}}*, date at which we expect to start testing our new release.
